Four-point Correlation Functions
=================================

There are currently two classes for calculating four-point auto-correlation functions:

.. toctree::

    nnnn
    gggg

Each of the above classes is a sub-class of the base class npcf, so they have a number of
features in common about how they are constructed. The common features are documented here.

.. autoclass:: orpheus.npcf.BinnedNPCF
