Direct estimator of aperture mass cumulants
===========================================

There is currently a class for computing higher-order aperture mass and aperture counts
statistics using the direct estimator approach.

.. toctree::

    directmapn
    directnapn

Each of the above classes is a sub-class of the base class DirectEstimator, so they have a number of
features in common about how they are constructed. The common features are documented here.
