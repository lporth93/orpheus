Three-point Correlation Functions
=================================

There are currently three differenct classes for calculating the different possible three-point correlation functions:

.. toctree::

    ggg
    gnn
    ngg

Each of the above classes is a sub-class of the base class npcf, so they have a number of
features in common about how they are constructed. The common features are documented here.
